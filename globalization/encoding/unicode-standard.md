# The Unicode standard

For a detailed description of all aspects of Unicode, refer to the [latest Unicode standard](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/).

The Unicode standard is kept closely synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646. See [Unicode and ISO 10646](https://www.unicode.org/faq/unicode_iso.html).

In many documents about Unicode, you will references to UCS which stands for Universal Coded Character Set.
UCS is obsolete terminology, however, and should be avoided.

"Encoding, representation, and handling of text" - wikipedia

> "...the Consortium's official publication includes a wide variety of details about the scripts and how to display them: normalization rules, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional text display order for multilingual texts, and so on"

## Unicode Transformation Formats (UTF)

The Unicode standard specifies a number of encodings of the Unicode character repertoire, including:

- UTF-8
- UTF-16
- UTF-32

One of the best summaries for the encoding of Unicode is the [Unicode FAQ: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM](https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html).
