# Frequently Asked Questions

## Windows Keyboard Layouts

[Where can I find graphical representations of the Windows Keyboard Layouts?]{}

Depictions are available in our Reference section: [Windows Keyboard Layouts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964651 "Windows Keyboard Layouts").

[How to add an input locale or keyboard layout?]{}

1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Control Panel**.
2.  Click **Keyboard**, and then click the **Input Locales** tab.
3.  Click **Add... button**.
4.  Select the input locale and keyboard layout/IM you want.
5.  Make sure the **Enable** indicator on the taskbar is checked and click **OK**.

You can click the indicator located on the right side of the taskbar to switch among installed keyboard layouts/IMEs.

**Note:** In Windows XP, some keyboard layouts are available only when required language collections are installed. In Windows 2000, some keyboard layouts are available only when required language groups are installed. To learn more, go to [Frequently Asked Questions: Locales and Languages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688174).

[Why do some layouts have two key assignments for the Euro currency symbol?]{}

The European Commission prefers the use of the AltGR+e key combination for the Euro currency symbol. We have also added it to some AltGR+5 key combination positions for ease of use.

[Why are some keys highlighted in color?]{}

The highlighted keys are traditionally called dead keys and are used in combination with other keys to create accented combination characters. These combinations are shown by the text box when you mouse over the key on the screen. The dead key functions as follows: When you hit the key nothing happens initially but then you hit the key that wants to wear that accent and a combination appears; if you hit a key that doesn't combine with the accent then you get the accent followed by the character; if you hit the dead key and a space bar, the accent on the dead key appears alone.

[How do I change the keyboard layout I'm using?]{}

After adding new input locales or keyboard layouts mentioned above, you can click the indicator located on the right side of the taskbar to switch among installed keyboard layouts/IMEs. Or you can use hot keys as listed in Control Panel/Keyboard/Input Locales/Hot keys for input locale.
