# User interface considerations for localization

You need to know how to design your user interface so that the localized content does not break the look and feel of your program.
The following will discuss how to minimize the resizing of your UI caused by languages that require more (or less) space for the same content; how to handle user interface controls like list boxes, combo boxes, buttons and so forth; and how to effectively use images and icons.

Note that while the examples show Windows applications, most of the underlying concepts are independent of the development framework you are using and apply to  desktop, mobile or web applications.
