# String handling for localizability

Once you have chosen a resource store, you can move on to the next area that causes a lot of localizability nightmares-the way strings are created for display in the UI or for placement in a persistent storage.
Many a translator has spent sleepless nights trying to decipher what a creative developer is attempting to convey to the user.
There are at least as many different ways to create strings of text as there are developers, and thus it would be impossible to include all of them here.
However, this section will focus on seven major areas to watch out for in relation to strings.

- [Avoid run-time string composition](avoid-run-time-composite-strings.md)

- [When variables are necessary, use unique names](when-variables-are-necessary.md)

- [Win32 - FormatMessage](win32-formatmessage.md)

- [.NET Framework - String.Format](dotnet-framework-string-format.md)

- [Do not compound several variables](do-not-compound-several-variables.md)

- [Keep sentences in a single string](keep-sentences-in-a-single-string.md)

- [Watch your string buffer sizes](watch-your-string-buffer-sizes.md)
