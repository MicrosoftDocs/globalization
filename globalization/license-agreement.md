# License agreement

Microsoft provides you with access to a variety of resources on Microsoft Learn's Globalization documentation (“Web Site”), including documentation, terminology and other product information (collectively the “Globalization Materials”). The Globalization Materials (including any updates, enhancements, new features, and/or the addition of any new Web properties to the Web Site) are subject to the [Microsoft Terms of Use](/legal/termsofuse) (“TOU”) and this Microsoft Learn Globalization License ( “License”), unless we have provided more specific terms, in which case those more specific terms will apply to the relevant item. If there is any conflict between the TOU and this License, this License will supersede the TOU. Microsoft reserves the right to update this License at any time without notice to you. The most current version of this License is available at [Microsoft Learn Globalization License](license-agreement.md). These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them.
