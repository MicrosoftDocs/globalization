# Globalize the test

The first step to test the world-readiness of a product is to verify that its functionality is globalized.
This can be done in part by globalizing test cases similar to globalizing the application.
In a single world-wide binary, globalization represents functionality that is an intrinsic, inseparable part of a system or product.
Globalized tests check for world-readiness at the same time you check the general functionality of a product.
