# Sample International Test Cases

The following list is provided as a possible foundation for internationalization of test plans. The test items are broken up into basic areas of functionality and are accompanied by details on how these areas can be verified, what the potential problems associated with certain areas are, and when the test is applicable.

The checklist shown in the following tables cannot possibly cover every situation that might arise; nor can it address all the numerous areas of functionality within individual applications. However, it does offer valuable guidelines for some of the more common areas of functionality that you should test.
