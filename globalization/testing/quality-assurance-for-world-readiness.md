# Quality assurance for world-readiness

<!-- TODO: QA as a separate organization is disappearing in a devops world 
Recast all the 'testing' content in terms of tqa activities (whoever does it).

The goal of ensuring world-readiness has a wider scope and requires more forethought than merely testing localized applications.
It must start early on by determining the necessary criteria for globalization.
Then the Quality Assurance (QA) organization must make sure that those implicit requirements are met throughout design and development.

For software products shipped to multiple markets, a single world-ready binary dramatically simplifies the QA process.
By using a single binary, you only have to deal with one product built for one specification, built by one development team, and there is only one binary that is tested, tracked, and supported later on.
Expanding the target market of the product becomes easier and more efficient because you do not need to completely retest the world-ready binary to sell it in another country.

Software design and development can easily break world-readiness when:

- Legacy single-language methods, thinking, and practices are used.

- International conventions are not considered.

- Text layout and other properties are not designed for.

Making software world-ready is a new goal for many software companies, and problems are likely to arise when new technologies and methods are applied.
The QA organization, especially those responsible for testing, must recognize the problem with test processes that are not world-ready.
Your testers must be prepared to prevent these problems or reduce their negative effect through proven solutions.

See "[Globalization of the Test](globalization-of-the-test.md)".
