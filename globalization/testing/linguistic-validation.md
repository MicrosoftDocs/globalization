# Linguistic validation

Linguistic validation can be an important step in ensuring quality translations of an application and documentation.
In this step of the validation process, a target language expert reviews translations to ensure that they're correct.

Performing linguistic validation can be a critical early step when first engaging a translation supplier or localizing with a new language.
Early linguistic validation is typically focused on samples of localized resources and content in isolation.
Later on, review can be conducted in the context of the running application ([In-Context Review (ICR)](in-context-review.md)).
Ideally, you complete both early linguistic validation and in-context reviews before release.

Linguistic reviews should be performed by native speakers of the language.
Using in-country reviewers is highly recommended to ensure that the localized content is aligned with target market expectations.

A linguistic reviewer looks at the following aspects:

| Aspect                     | Description |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Source quality             | Is the source text well-written? Poor quality at source makes translation difficult. |
| Grammar and spelling       | Is the translation grammatically correct and use the proper spelling? |
| Accuracy                   | Does the translation accurately represent the intent and meaning of the source text? If it doesn't, is the resource missing annotations to provide missing context? |
| Contextual adherence       | Is the translation appropriate for the context it appears in? |
| Style guide adherence      | Does the tone and vocabulary of the translation adhere to the project's style guide? |
| Terminology and vocabulary | Is the terminology correct and suitable for the target audience? |
| Consistency                | Are the same ideas and terminology used consistently across the translations? |
| Cultural appropriateness   | Is the translation a good fit for the target culture? The translation may be too literal a translation of the source text. |
| Correct formats for data   | Is the formatting of data correct for the target culture? |

While linguistic review is primarily focused on the linguistic and cultural aspects of the translation, the reviewer will naturally observe other problems that can occur because of localization.
All issues should be captured and reported in the review process.

The following recommendations can improve the effectiveness of linguistic review:

* There could be a high volume of translated material where a complete review is too expensive or time-consuming to achieve.
As a consequence, linguistic reviewers may examine only samples of the translations.
Samples may be chosen randomly or focus on known or probable problem areas.

* Reviewers should have a responsive communication channel with the product team to answer questions or resolve ambiguities.

* Consider whether to use the same translation supplier or engage a third-party reviewer to ensure an objective validation.

* Many languages are spoken in multiple countries and cultures, so expectations for in-country reviews need to be clearly set.
  For example, Spanish, French, and Arabic are spoken in multiple countries and regions, with significant vocabulary and terminology differences.
  The most common strategy for such languages is to release a single "neutral" version of the language that can be made acceptable among target markets.
  For some languages like Portuguese, the differences between regions are so significant that the "neutral" language may not be appropriate.

* In-country reviews also help validate the need for adding extra language variants to cater for significant linguistic differences among markets.
  Market size and terminology differences could be factors in choosing to add a specific variant of a language, such as for French for Canada, and Spanish for Mexico.
