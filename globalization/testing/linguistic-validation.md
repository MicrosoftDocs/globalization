# Linguistic validation

Linguistic validation can be an important step in ensuring quality translations of an application and documentation.
In this step of the validation process, a target language expert reviews translations to ensure that they're correct.

Performing linguistic validation can be a critical early step when first engaging a translation supplier or piloting a new language.

A linguistic reviewer looks at the following aspects:

| Aspect                     | Description |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Source quality             | Is the source text well-written? Poor quality at source makes translation difficult. |
| Grammar and spelling       | Is the translation grammatically correct and use the proper spelling? |
| Accuracy                   | Does the translation accurately represent the intent and meaning of the source text? If it doesn't, is the resource missing annotations to provide missing context? |
| Contextual adherence       | Is the translation appropriate for the context it appears in? |
| Style guide adherence      | Does the tone and vocabulary of the translation adhere to the project's style guide? |
| Terminology and vocabulary | Is the terminology correct and suitable for the target audience? |
| Consistency                | Are the same ideas and terminology used consistently across the translations? |
| Cultural appropriateness   | Is the translation a good fit for the target culture? The translation may be too literal a translation of the source text. |
| Correct formats for data   | Is the formatting of data correct for the target culture? |

While linguistic review is primarily focused on the linguistic aspects of the translation, the reviewer will naturally observe other problems that can occur during localization.
All issues should be captured and reported in the review process.

The following recommendations can improve the effectiveness of linguistic review:

* There could be a high volume of translated material where a complete review is too expensive or time-consuming to achieve.
As a consequence, linguistic reviewers may examine only samples of the translations.
Samples may be chosen randomly or focus on known or probable problem areas.

* Reviewers should have a responsive communication channel with the product team to answer questions or resolve ambiguities.

* Consider whether to use the same translation supplier or engage a third-party reviewer to ensure an objective validation.

* Perform linguistic validation in the context of the running application.
More problems can be observed when the linguistic validation is performed in the context of the user's experience, rather than at the resource level.
See [In-Context Review (ICR)](in-context-review.md) for more information.

* For areas that may be challenging to see in-context, such as error messages, the validation must be performed at the resource level.
