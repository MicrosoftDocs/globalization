# Prioritize components for globalization testing

Some components are more likely to have globalization problems than others, so adapt your testing practices accordingly.
To focus and manage your efforts, assign a globalization priority to all components that are going to be tested.
Top priority goes to:

* Components that extensively handle text data.

* Components using files for data storage or data exchange.

* Components that have had globalization problems in the past.

After determining which components are more likely to have globalization errors, choose a viable test platform in accordance with your particular circumstances.
See [Choose a test platform](choose-a-test-platform.md).
