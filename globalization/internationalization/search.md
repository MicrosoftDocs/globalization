# Search

A friendly search facility allows the discovery of content using a variety of words to refer to the same thing.
The synonyms of a given word will vary widely by language.
In one language you may have fifteen synonyms for a word, but in a different language there may be no synonyms at all.
This means you can't simply translate your source language synonyms.
While most string localization has a simple one-to-one relationship between source string and target string, that is not the case with synonym lists.
So, your implementation and the corresponding string definitions must account for the special needs of search.
You will also need to provide localizers with the context of this special content, and may even require engaging specialists to develop these synonym lists for your target languages.
