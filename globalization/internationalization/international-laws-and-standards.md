# International laws and standards

A global application sold to international markets must conform to the laws and standards of each market and business. To understand your risks and obligations, you should consult an expert.
Here are some basic guidelines to get you started.

## Security

[Security guidelines for international](security-guidelines.md) outlines things to consider at the intersection of internationalization and security.
For information on security, see [Microsoft Security Engineering](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering).

## Privacy and international law

Privacy is an important consideration in many countries. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) applies to anyone doing business in or with the EU. See [EUR-Lex -32018R1725](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725) for official versions of the regulation. For information about GDPR, and for information about how to honor rights and fulfill GDPR obligations when using Microsoft products and services, please see [General Data Protection Regulation Summary](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr).

## Intellectual property, copyright, and piracy

Intellectual property, copyright, and piracy laws vary widely by market.
In many markets, you may be subject to legal action if you violate local laws.
Some countries have signed international copyright laws, such as the [TRIPS Agreement 1994](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm "Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights") and/or the [Berne Convention 1928](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/ "Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works").
If using another entity's components — open-source or not — it is important to understand the license agreement associated with that code and to adhere to that agreement.
See [Intellectual property and open innovation](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty "Legal aspects of intellectual property and open innovation") to learn about the multiple modes of intellectual property and open innovation systems that Microsoft relies on and participates in.

## Encryption declaration

Cryptography laws vary by country.
Some countries ban encryption in communication, while some require a license to use encrypted software, or require that police have decryption keys in case they are needed in an investigation.

For example, although encryption in France is perfectly legal, it is subject to strict government control regarding its distribution (supply), import/export, and usage. Your product may need to submit the necessary approvals to the French government prior to shipping to France.

[World map of encryption laws and policies](https://www.gp-digital.org/world-map-of-encryption/ "Encryption laws and policies in different countries") gives the laws and policies of different countries.

## Language laws

[*La Loi de Toubon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toubon_Law) (Toubon Law) applies to products and services sold in France, no matter which country they're from.
It requires the use of the French language in the designation, marketing, presentation (i.e., labels, leaflets, catalogues, brochures, order forms, product sheets, delivery slips, etc.),
instructions for use (whether on paper, audio, through an online resource, or built into the software),
the description of the extent and the conditions of guarantee,
as well as in announcements (including advertising) intended for the general public.

In Canada by its constitution, both French and English are official languages. In addition to the requirement that government services be available in both languages, there are further laws that "places obligations on private actors in Canadian society to provide access to goods or services in both official languages (such as the requirement that food products be labeled in both English and French)." In the province of Québec, French was declared the official language by Bill 96. See [National Assembly of Québec: Bill 96](http://m.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-96-42-1.html "An Act respecting French, the official and common language of Québec") for an explanation of the scope of where French is to be used in Québec.  

English and French are a fundamental characteristic of the Canadian identity, and the importance of language rights is clearly recognized in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, part of the Constitution Act of 1982.
There are laws requiring access to goods or services in both official languages.
For more information, please see [About official languages and bilingualism](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/official-languages-bilingualism/about.html).

Other markets have their own laws and new laws are added by countries periodically.

## Entry to market

Some markets may require you to register your software before it can be distributed or sold in that market.
The perquisites and processes vary by market.
For example, China requires that software and services support the national standard: [GB18030 code page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030).

## End-User License Agreement (EULA)

For any product that supplies a legal document, such as an End-User License Agreement (EULA), you will need to engage a lawyer that understands EULA legislation and the laws of the country in which the document will apply. It is probably best to write separate documents for each target country, rather than to write one document and translate it for each country. Or, if you write only a master document, you may need to engage a translation agency that specializes in legal translation to ensure your company does not open itself to risk.

## Laws or standards particular to your program

For applications that target specific functionality — such as taxes or health care — keep in mind that different laws and standards apply and your program may be liable to adhere to those laws.
For example, you may need to conform to the US [Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act) regulations, the European Union [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725) regulations, or the Canadian [Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/) regulations, depending on the markets you are targeting.
