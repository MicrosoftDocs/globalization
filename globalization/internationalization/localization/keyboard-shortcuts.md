# Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts might need to be changed according to the translated text that contains these shortcuts. For example, the F key is used as the shortcut for "**F**ile" in English. This shortcut needs to be modified during German localization to the D key because the same word in German-"**D**atei"-does not have the "F" character in its name. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean do not have a Latin-based script that allows for single-key shortcuts. For this group of languages, a common practice is to keep the source language's original Latin-based shortcuts such as "![Latin-based shortcut](https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688140.elements_1(en-us).gif)(F)". When there are standard shortcuts for common functions in localized products, localizers should use these shortcuts and not create new ones.
