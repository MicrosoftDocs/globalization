# OpenType font format

OpenType is a font format developed jointly by Microsoft and Adobe as an extension of Apple's TrueType font format.
The OpenType 1.0 font specification was released in 1997.
Since the release of the 1.0 specification, Adobe and Microsoft have continued to work together updating and refining the specification.
Several other companies, including Apple and Monotype, have contributed to the specification over the years.
Currently, every major font foundry and most minor ones are developing fonts in OpenType format.

[Microsoft Typography](/typography) is a deep resource for information on Microsoft fonts, explanations of how fonts work in Windows, and detailed guides for font development.
