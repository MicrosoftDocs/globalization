# Microsoft language resources

The language resources on this page can help you develop localized versions of applications that integrate with Microsoft products. By using the same terminology and style that Microsoft uses, your customers will find it easier to get started with your applications when used with Microsoft products.

## Terminology

Microsoft Terminology can be used to ensure that terminology in your localized versions of applications match the corresponding terminology in Microsoft products. It can also be used to integrate Microsoft terminology into other terminology collections or serve as a base IT glossary for language development in the nearly 100 languages available. You can query the Microsoft Terminology via the <a href="https://msit.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjM4MzYyNGQtNjU1MS00ZWE2LTlkY2YtNzllYWVmMWRkMDc4IiwidCI6IjcyZjk4OGJmLTg2ZjEtNDFhZi05MWFiLTJkN2NkMDExZGI0NyIsImMiOjV9" target="_blank">Microsoft Terminology Search</a> page. [Microsoft terminology](./microsoft-terminology.md) is also provided in [.tbx format](https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/2/d/b2db7a7c-8d33-47f3-b2c1-ee5e6445cf45/MicrosoftTermCollection.zip), an industry standard for terminology exchange.

## Localization Style Guides

[Microsoft Style Guides](./microsoft-style-guides.md) are collections of rules that define language and style conventions for specific languages. These rules usually include general localization guidelines, information on language style and usage in technical publications, and information on market-specific data formats.

## Regional Formats

You can browse regional formats for the locales used in various versions of Windows via the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Regional Formats TODO: temporary link</a> page.
