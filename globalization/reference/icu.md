# International Components for Unicode (ICU)

International Components for Unicode (ICU) is a mature, widely used set of open-source globalization APIs.
ICU utilizes Unicode's vast Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) as its data library, providing globalization support for software applications.
ICU is widely portable and gives applications the same results across on all platforms.

Implementations of ICU are available for a number of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Javascript, and Rust.
Partial implementations are available for .NET.

In Windows 10 Creators Update, ICU was integrated into Windows, making the C APIs and data publicly and readily accessible.
See [windows/win32/intl/international-components-for-unicode--icu-](/windows/win32/intl/international-components-for-unicode--icu-) for more information about the ICU that is included in Windows.
