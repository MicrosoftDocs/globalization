# International Laws and Standards

The legal requirements for your software will vary by market and business. If your software is distributed globally, then it must adhere to all local laws. To understand your risks and obligations, you should consult an expert. Below are some basic guidelines to get you started.

## **Security**

The [[Security Guidelines for International](security-guidelines.md) outlines things to consider at the intersection of internationalization and security. For information on security specifically, reference the [Security Developer Center](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/security/).]{}

## **Privacy and International Law**

Privacy is an important consideration in many countries. The [Supplier Privacy Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/procurement/toolkit-default.aspx) provides a good introduction on how to approach privacy.

## **Intellectual Property, Copyright, and Piracy**

Intellectual property, copyright, and piracy laws vary widely by market. In many markets, you may be subject to legal action if you violate local laws. Some countries have signed international copyright laws, such as the [TRIPS Agreement 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_Trade-Related_Aspects_of_Intellectual_Property_Rights "Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights") and/or the [Berne Convention 1928](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works "Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works") . If using another entity’s components—open-source or not—it is important to understand the license agreement associated with that code and to adhere to that agreement.

## **Encryption Declaration**

Cryptography laws vary by country. Some countries ban encryption in communication, while some require a license to use encrypted software, or require that police have decryption keys in case they are needed in an investigation.

Although encryption in France is perfectly legal, it is subject to strict government control regarding its distribution (supply), import/export, and usage. Your product may need to submit the necessary approvals to the French government prior to shipping to France.

## Language Laws

[*La Loi de Toubon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toubon_Law)(Toubon Law) applies to products and services sold in France (no matter which country they’re from) and requires the use of the French language in the designation, marketing, presentation (i.e., labels, leaflets, catalogues, brochures, order forms, product sheets, delivery slips, etc.), instructions for use (whether on paper, audio, through an online resource, or built in the software), the description of the extent and the conditions of guarantee, as well as in announcements (including advertising) intended for the general public.

Constitutionally, both French and English are official language of Canada. In addition to the requirement that government services be available in both languages, there are further laws that “places obligations on private actors in Canadian society to provide access to goods or services in both official languages (such as the requirement that food products be labeled in both English and French).” For more information, please see Wikipedia’s article on [Official Bilingualism in Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilingualism_in_Canada).

Other markets have their own laws and new laws are added by countries periodically.

## Entry to Market

Some markets may require you to register your software before it can be distributed or sold in that market. The perquisites and processes vary by market. For example, China requires that software and services support the national standard, the [GB18030 code page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030).

## **EULAs**

For any product that supplies a legal document, such as an End-User License Agreement (EULA). You will need to engage a lawyer that understands EULA legislation, international law, and nuances of providing a document in a particular language that varies in different jurisdictions (such as English for the United States and the United Kingdom, or French for Canada and France). Additionally, you may need to engage a translation agency that specializes in legal translation to ensure your company does not open itself to risk.

## Laws or Standards Particular to Your Program

For applications that target specific functionality—such as taxes or health care—keep in mind that different laws and standards apply and your program may be liable to adhere to those laws. You may need to conform to the US’s [Health InsurancePortability & Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act) , the European Union’s (EU’s) [Data Protection Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive) or Canada’s [Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Information_Protection_and_Electronic_Documents_Act) depending on the markets you are targeting.
