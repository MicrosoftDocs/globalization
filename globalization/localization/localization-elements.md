# Localization Elements

The development team should supply the localization team with a single binary that works well for all different locales. The localization team will expect that the software has been designed and created to meet locale-aware and localizability standards. The UI elements should be stored in the resource files of a program or in some other resource repository. If the development team has not done this, localizers should ask the development team to put the resources in a standard format, so that localization tools can handle them.

There are many elements that are modified in both software and content localization. These elements include text, layout, graphics and multimedia, keyboard shortcuts, fonts, character sets and locale data, as well as the product's build process and packaging.
