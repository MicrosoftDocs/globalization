# Top 10 Tips for Microsoft Translation into German

Are you helping with translation into German, but don't have time to study all aspects of the [German Style Guide](../../reference/microsoft-style-guides.md)? Here are ten of the most important aspects to keep in mind.

## 1. Translate sense not words

The language in Microsoft products should have the "feel" of a product originally written in German, using idiomatic syntax and terminology, while at the same time maintaining a high level of consistency. That guarantees the maximum user experience and usability for our customers. Sticking too closely to the original text will make it sound unnatural. Use correct technical terminology but express the sense you got from the source text as if you were writing in German. Then, read your translation out loud to check whether it sounds like something you would say in German.

Example:

_English_: Compose your vision within the cloud.

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Lassen Sie Ihrer Kreativität freien Lauf.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Realisieren Sie in der Cloud Ihre Vision.":::

## 2. Keep product names in English

There is no need to leave a term in English, if a good German term is available. To be clear, a number of German IT terms are borrowed from English (e.g., _Server_, _Client_, _Agent_). But when available, give preference to German native terms. That makes the text more user-friendly and is more accessible to users who are not familiar with loanwords.

Example:

_English_: to upload

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="hochladen":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="uploaden":::

_English_: firstline worker

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Mitarbeiter in Service und Produktion":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Firstline Worker":::

This is a rough rule: [Trademarked names](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/en-us.aspx) and the name "Microsoft Corporation" often remain in English, unless an approved German name for the trademark is available. Application, product, and sometimes even feature names may be trademarked and therefore often remain in English.

Example:

_English_: Microsoft Office 365 Developer Technical Preview

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Microsoft Office 365 Developer Technical Preview":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Microsoft Office 365 Betaversion für Entwickler":::

_English_: Windows Desktop Application Program

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Windows-Desktopanwendungsprogramm":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Windows Desktop Application Program":::

## 3. Follow the tone and style of the original English

[Microsoft voice](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human) targets a broad set of users from technology enthusiasts to casual computer users. Translating Microsoft's voice into German means choosing words and grammatical structures that reflect the Microsoft style: clear and friendly, concise without sounding robot-like. But it also means considering the needs of the audience (e.g., children vs. adults) and the intent of the text (e.g., entertaining, informative, instructional).

Example:

_English_: You can:…

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Sie haben folgende Möglichkeiten:…":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Hier kannst du…":::

## 4. Choose gender-neutral language

Regardless of the audience, avoid gender stereotypes and aim to be as gender-neutral as possible. For example, instead of using phrases which specifically mention genders, use general language that includes all genders. A good solution is the use of the plural or abstraction (e.g., _:::no-loc text="-Arbeitskraft, Schulungspersonal, Fachhilfe":::_). Where gender specificity cannot be avoided without sounding awkward, choose inclusive language to cover all genders.

In short text or text strings, for titles, or when a group is composed of women and men, make conscious choices. Acceptable approaches are camel casing (e.g., _:::no-loc text="DoktorandIn":::_) or a slash (e.g., _:::no-loc text="Entwickler/in":::_). Do not use an underscore (e.g., _:::no-loc text="Mitarbeiter_innen":::_).

Example:

_English_: This recipient may not answer, as their status is set to "Out of office."

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Sie erhalten möglicherweise keine Antwort, da dieser Kontakt den Status "Abwesend" hat.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Diese(r) Empfänger(in) antwortet möglicherweise nicht, da er/sie den Status "Abwesend" hat.":::

When you use gender-neutral pronouns (e.g. :::no-loc text="man, jemand, niemand, wer":::), be consistent and follow through. Passive voice is a typical of the German language. While the Microsoft style is active, passive voice may be used to achieve gender-neutral language.

Example:

_English_: You must not discriminate someone because of their age.

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Niemand darf aufgrund seines Alters benachteiligt werden.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Niemand darf aufgrund des Alters benachteiligt werden.":::

Passive voice is a typical aspect of the German language. While Microsoft style is active, passive voice can be used to achieve gender-neutral language.

If the text is about an individual and the gender is clear, not being specific sounds awkward. In this case: be specific.

Example:

_English_: Jane Doe is our HR director. She is our expert for human resources.

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Erika Müller ist Personalchefin. Sie ist unsere Expertin in Sachen Personal.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Erika Müller ist Personalchef. Sie ist unser Experte in Sachen Personal.":::

## 5. Follow English pronouns, but adapt to German style

The use of personal pronouns is a powerful way to express all the attributes of the Microsoft voice. Third-person references, such as "user," are avoided as they sound formal and impersonal. The German Microsoft voice follows the usage of the US English voice if this does not impact grammar or create redundancy. Addressing the user by first-person or second-person pronouns conveys the meaning that this person is not anonymous. The usage of we generates the image of a team behind the software who cares about what the user is doing.

In technical contexts, the use of "we" may sound too personal in German and may need to be replaced with a more neutral translation even if "we" is used in the source text. Always check the use of pronouns in context.

Example:

_English_: We found issues.

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Es sind Probleme aufgetreten.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Wir haben Probleme gefunden.":::

## 6. Strike the right formality

German is a more formal language. Most notably, we have the formal (:::no-loc text="Sie":::) and the informal way (:::no-loc text="Du":::) of addressing people. It has become more common to address others with the informal :::no-loc text="Du":::, particularly in advertisements or gaming contexts. While Microsoft's voice is generally less formal, consistency is important. To assure that all translators use the same approach, we recommend using Sie, unless you are addressing children under 18.

Example:

_English_: What you can do next:

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Sie können wie folgt fortfahren:":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Was du als nächstes machen kannst:":::

_English_: Ask your parent for permission to see this website.

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Frag deine Eltern, ob du diese Website anzeigen darfst.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Bitten Sie Ihre Eltern um Erlaubnis, ob Sie diese Webseite anzeigen dürfen.":::

## 7. Break up long compounds

German words can be very long (e.g., _:::no-loc text=".NET Framework Windows-Ressourcenlokalisierungs-Editor":::_). Overly complex compounds (_:::no-loc text="Komposita":::_) should be avoided as they are unintuitive and become a usability issue. Compounds should be understandable and clear. The entry for _:::no-loc text="Kompositum":::_ in Duden has details. Here are the most important guidelines for Microsoft material.

Words with three or fewer components are spelt as one word.

Example:

_English_: default home page

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Standardhomepage":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Standard-Homepage":::

Words with four components are hyphenated.

Example:

_English_: home page file name

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Homepage-Dateiname":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Homepagedateiname":::

English product names are spelt just like they are in English.

Example:

_English_: Skype Manager Administrator

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Skype Manager Administrator":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Skype-Manager-Administrator":::

A hyphen is placed between a product name and a term to set the product name off from the word that follows in a compound. This rule applies even if the word that follows is an English term. The only exception is a product name directly followed by the term "Setup," because Setup is treated as a product name.

Example:

_English_: Dynamics 365 home page

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Dynamics 365-Homepage":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Dynamics 365 Homepage":::

_English_: Office Setup Assistant

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Office-Setup-Assistent":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Office Setup Assistent":::

## 8. Avoid abbreviations

English text generally has a high number of abbreviations. German uses fewer abbreviations to begin with. We often can't avoid using acronyms and other short forms due to space limitations. Unless they are very well known or even the preferred term (e.g., WLAN, SaaS), use the full forms. It enhances readability and understanding. Do not invent new abbreviations.

Example:

_English_: GPS

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Navigationssystem":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="GPS":::

## 9. Use :::no-loc text="ß"::: where appropriate

The letter :::no-loc text="ẞ"::: (:::no-loc text="ß - ẞ":::) is now an official letter in German orthography. Use it to replace the capital "SS" in words that are written in capital letters.

Example:

_English_: STREET

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="STRAẞE":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="STRASSE":::

## 10. Use the right reference material
