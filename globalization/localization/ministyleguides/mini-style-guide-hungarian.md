# Top 10 Tips for Microsoft Translation into Hungarian

Are you helping with translation into Hungarian, but don't have time to study all aspects of the [Hungarian Style Guide](../../reference/microsoft-style-guides.md)? Here are ten of the most important aspects to keep in mind.

## 1. Translate sense, not words

The language in Microsoft products should have the "feel" of a product originally written in Hungarian, using idiomatic syntax and terminology, while maintaining a high level of consistency in terminology. That guarantees the maximum user experience and usability for our customers. Sticking too closely to the original text, especially word-for-word translation, will make the tone of the translation stiff and unnatural.

Read your translation aloud to check whether it sounds like something you would say in Hungarian.

Example:

_English_: Don't let the creativity stop

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Tartsa ébren kreativitását.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Ne hagyja leállni kreativitását.":::

Example:

_English_: iOS is a popular platform for creating apps that are touch first, fun, and engaging.

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Az iOS népszerű platform szórakoztató és lebilincselő érintésvezérléses alkalmazások létrehozására.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Az iOS egy népszerű platform olyan alkalmazások létrehozására, amelyek elsőre megérintik, szórakoztatják és lebilincselik a felhasználókat.":::

## 2. Follow the tone and style of the English original

The [Microsoft voice](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human) targets a broad set of users from technology enthusiasts and professionals to casual computer users. Translating the Microsoft voice into Hungarian means choosing words and grammatical structures that reflect the Microsoft style: warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand. But it also means considering the needs of the audience (for example, children versus adults) and the intent of the text (for example, entertaining, informative, or instructional).

Example:

_English_: You can choose:…

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="A következő lehetőségekből választhat:…":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Itt választhatja:…":::

## 3. Follow English pronouns, but adapt to Hungarian style

The use of personal pronouns is a powerful way to express all the attributes of the Microsoft voice. Third-person references, such as "user," are avoided because they sound formal and impersonal. Address the user as "you" to convey an awareness than the reader is a real individual, not some anonymous person.

The use of "we" to refer to Microsoft evokes the image of a team behind the software who cares about what the user is doing.
In technical contexts, the use of "we" might sound too personal in Hungarian and might need to be replaced by a more neutral translation even if "we" is used in the source text. Always check the use of pronouns in context.

Example:

_English_: We found issues.

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Problémák jelentkeztek.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Problémákat találtunk.":::

## 4. Strike the right level of formality

Hungarian is a more formal language than English. For "you," we have the formal (_Ön_) and the informal (_te_) way of addressing people. It has become more common to address others with the informal "you," particularly in advertisements or gaming contexts. Although Microsoft's voice is generally less formal, consistency is important. To assure that all translators use the same approach, we recommend using _önözés_, unless you are addressing children under 18.

Example:

_English_: What you can do next:

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Az alábbiak szerint folytathatja:":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Amit a következőkben választhatsz:":::

Example:

_English_: Ask your parent for permission to see this website.

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Kérdezd meg szüleid, hogy megnézheted-e ezt a webhelyet.":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Kérjen engedélyt szüleitől a webhely megtekintésére.":::

## 5. Keep product names in English

This is the general rule: trademarked names and the name Microsoft Corporation shouldn't be localized unless local laws require translation and an approved translated form of the trademark is available. Here is a [list of Microsoft trademarks](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/en-us.aspx).

Decline product names—except for those that are marked with a trademark (&trade;) symbol or registered trademark (&reg;) symbol—wherever you can and it's appropriate (_Skype-ban_, _Lynckel_, _Office-t_). You can also decline the names of websites and web pages (for example, _office.com-ról_, _microsoft.com-ot_).

The names of applications, products, and sometimes even features may be trademarked and therefore often remain in English. For the correct translation of product and service names (if they are translatable), refer to Trademarks section.

Example:

_English_: Azure Advanced Threat Protection

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="Azure Advanced Threat Protection":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Azure Komplex veszélyforrások elleni védelem":::

Example:

_English_: Windows Desktop Application Program

_Our style_: :::no-loc text="asztali Windows-alkalmazás program":::

_Not our style_: :::no-loc text="Windows Desktop Application Program":::

## 6. Avoid long or complex compounds

Compounds should be understandable and clear to the user. Any word or phrase that is very long or overcomplicated should be avoided, even if it is grammatically correct. Also, do not create a new word when a word for that concept already exists. For example, instead of _beépülőmodul-letöltés_, _beépülő modulok letöltése_ is preferred.

Keep in mind: if there is an implicit relationship between the words of a phrase that could be explained only by additional words, phrases, or suffixes, then the phrase must be considered a compound word and must be written accordingly (in one word or connected with a hyphen). For example, _magyartanár_ (teacher of Hungarian) is a compound word, whereas _magyar tanár_ (Hungarian teacher) is not.

Compound words can be written as one word with no spaces or joined with a hyphen. If the compound word consists of more than two words but less than seven syllables, it must be written in one word, without a hyphen—for example, _adatbázisindex_ (database index), but _adatbázis-tervezés_ (database design). When a suffix is added that modifies the part of speech, the suffix itself is treated as a syllable, so adding a suffix makes the word longer than six syllables, and the word must be hyphenated—for example, _háttérvilágítás_ (backlight illumination) versus _háttér-világítású_ (backlight illuminated). (An exception is the ending _i_, which does not count as a syllable.)

For more details, please see the reference section.

## 7. Do not invent new abbreviations and acronyms

Overall, Hungarian uses fewer abbreviations than English does. Only use common abbreviations listed in Abbreviations section (such as _pl._ for _például_ and _tel._ for _telefon_). If a less-known abbreviation is used, its meaning should also be supplied in parentheses on the first occurrence.

Acronyms are words made up of the initial letters of major parts of a compound term. Common examples are WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), DNS (Domain Name Server), and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). We often can't avoid using acronyms and other short forms because space in the user interface is limited. Unless they are very well known (for example, URL, RAM, and MIDI) or even the preferred term (for example, WLAN and SaaS), use the full forms. It enhances readability and understanding. Do not invent new abbreviations.

## 8. Use accurate terminology

There is no need to leave a term in English if a good Hungarian term is available. To be clear, a good number of Hungarian IT terms are borrowed from English (for example, _fájl_, _szoftver_). But when available, give preference to Hungarian native terms—for example, _kiszolgáló_ (server), _ügyfél_ (client). That gives a text a friendlier tone and makes it more accessible to users who are not familiar with loanwords.

## 9. Assure consistency

Ensure that your translation is consistent in terms of terminology, formatting, and content. Use the spell checker and other tools to assure quality.

## 10. Use the right reference material

When more than one solution is possible, consult the other topics in this style guide for guidance. There is more, of course. If you have questions, consult the following resources for additional guidance.

1. _A magyar helyesírás szabályai_, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, latest edition: This is the official collection of the rules of Hungarian grammar issued by the Hungarian Scientific Academy; plus, it contains a limited number of basic Hungarian words. The online edition is available at <http://helyesiras.mta.hu/helyesiras/default/akh12> (rules only).
2. _Helyesírás_, Osiris Kiadó, Budapest, 2005: This is an extended version of the previous book. It discusses several cases that are not or just marginally covered by the previous publication, plus it contains a more comprehensive dictionary of more than 200,000 words.
3. For special questions not covered by the above publications (for example, the latest geographical names, new issues not yet covered), contact the Linguistic Institute of the Hungarian Scientific Academy or the relevant organization (for example, the Hungarian Committee on Geographical Names, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and so on).
