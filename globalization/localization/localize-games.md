# Localize games

Video game localization requires an understanding of the game development process, storytelling techniques, and interactive elements, as the focus is on entertainment, engagement, narrative, and character development. This makes game localization stand apart from other types of software localization, which primarily focuses on functionality and utility, and uses textual elements that are concise and neutral in tone.

Localized text, audio, and multimedia in games must sound natural and genre-appropriate to maintain audience immersion. This extends to the marketing material, the game’s webpage, and other supporting material: they should use the same style and register as the game itself to avoid breaking players’ immersion.

Games often have extensive narrative elements, including dialog, prose, and storylines. Localizing these elements needs to capture the essence of the source content, including its humor, cultural references, and other elements that help to keep players enthralled by the game world. For example, if a game maintains a tone of family-friendly, dry humor throughout, this should also be true of the localized version.

Audio and video localization for games is a crucial part, much more so that with software. It usually means re-creation  of the source material: translation adaptation, casting, directing, and lip-syncing to match facial animations might all be needed. This adds complexity and cost.

## Special concerns

Video games have some unique concerns that don’t usually apply to software, starting with age ratings. There are two widely adopted systems: ESRB in North America and PEGI in Europe. Some countries use their own ratings system instead, such as Germany’s USK. Localized versions attempt to stay within the same age rating, although there are cases where a game will receive a different age rating in different markets.

Games also carry a higher geopolitical and cultural risk, especially if they take place in what is more or less our real world. Many people do not like seeing their nation or culture portrayed as the villain. As with films, sometimes you might not want to release a game in certain markets due to geopolitical or cultural concerns.
