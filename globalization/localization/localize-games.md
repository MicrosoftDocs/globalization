# Localize games

Video game localization requires an understanding of the game development process, storytelling techniques, and interactive elements, as the focus is on entertainment, engagement, narrative, and character development. This makes game localization stand apart from other types of [software localization](localize-software.md), which primarily focuses on functionality and utility, and uses textual elements that are concise and neutral in tone.

Localized text, audio, and multimedia in games must sound natural and genre-appropriate to maintain audience immersion. This extends to the marketing material, the game’s webpage, and other supporting material: they should use the same style and register as the game itself to avoid breaking players’ immersion.

Games often have extensive narrative elements, including dialog, prose, and storylines. Localizing these elements needs to capture the essence of the source content, including its humor, cultural references, and other elements that help to keep players enthralled by the game world. For example, if a game maintains a tone of family-friendly, dry humor throughout, this should also be true of the localized version.

Audio and video localization for games is a crucial part, much more so that with software. It usually means [re-creation](../media/re-creation.md) of the source material: translation adaptation, casting, directing, and lip-syncing to match facial animations might all be needed. This adds complexity and cost.

## Special concerns

Video games have some unique concerns that don’t usually apply to software, starting with age ratings. As part of localization planning, you should consider the game's rating in the source market, the preferred rating in the target markets, and what adjustments might be needed to meet those ratings. As mentioned above, localization needs to start early enough, so that rating guidelines for translators and voice actors can be established as soon as possible. There are two widely adopted age rating systems: ESRB in North America and PEGI in Europe. Some countries use their own ratings system instead, such as Germany’s USK. Ratings in different systems are broadly similar but not identical, so localization choices (mainly language-related) might be guided by the need to hit the right rating in the target market. Localized versions attempt to stay within the same age rating, although there are cases where a game will receive a different age rating in different markets.

Below is a list of concerns that affects a game’s age rating. The more frequent, explicit, extreme, or gross each category gets, the higher the rating will be.

- Frightening sounds or images (in case of very young children)
- Violence
- Language
- Sexual content
- Use of drugs or alcohol
- Gambling

Of these, language is the main thing that can be affected by localization choices. Sometimes English profanities are not felt as “strongly” as those in other languages, so the localization might need to tone those down to stay within the intended rating. In most cases it is better to be conservative with the use of profanity if you are unsure. There are also some issues that require the visual assets of the game to be changed: for example, the swastika symbol might need to be removed for the German market.

Games also carry a higher geopolitical and cultural risk, especially if they take place in what is basically the real world. Many people do not like seeing their nation or culture portrayed as the villain or treated in stereotypical fashion, for example, treating all African countries as identical. Games with fantasy opponents, that is, something that doesn’t exist in our world, are safer in this regard. As with films, sometimes you might not want to release a game in certain markets due to geopolitical or cultural concerns.
