## Localization strategy by content type

Software, content, and game localization each have their particular characteristics that drive different localization strategies.

"Content" includes user assistance (help), marketing materials, License Agreements, images, video, and so on.
These materials don't possess a unique and durable identifier for each unit of localization.
Content is localized a whole file at a time.

In software, each localizable string or other resource has a unique and durable identifier.
This identifier allows for accurate recycling and management of the translation.
