# Transcreation localization strategy

Transcreation is the process of adapting content from one language or culture to another while maintaining essential aspects of the source.
You can think of the result as being "inspired by" the source content, rather than a direct translation.

Transcreation can require language or domain experts or local talent.
It can be expensive and require longer lead times.
Marketing and advertising content is often localized by transcreation.
Any area where a direct translation is insufficient to meet market needs is a candidate for transcreation.

This strategy may be necessary for highly language-dependent features of a product.
Examples may include:

- Domain-specific features. Consider "Tax" versus "VAT", for example.
- Predictive text features.
- Dictionary, thesaurus, grammar, and spelling features.
- Search features. For example, creating synonym lists for search terms.
- Different features or content for a specific market.
- Highlighting different features of the product for a given market in marketing material.
- Comparisons to other products/competitors in a given market in marketing material.
