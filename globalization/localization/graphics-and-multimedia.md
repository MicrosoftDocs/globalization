# Graphics and Multimedia

One of the advantages of graphics is that they can communicate more universally than text, provided they are not culture-specific. Graphical UI components of the software product might need to be revised for the international audience. Use images that are not geared toward a particular culture or locale, and avoid including text within graphics. These practices will help minimize the localization of graphics, which is very expensive and often causes the shipping of the product to be delayed.

You will also need to retake UI screen shots for the localized versions of the product. Icons that have a particular directional orientation-such as Undo and Repeat-will need to be localized for bidirectional languages in order to be locale-aware. (For more information, see [Mirroring Awareness](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688119 "Mirroring Awareness").) The same concept applies to music and video. For instance, suppose you want to use music to indicate that the computer is calculating an equation. Because the famous U.S. game show "Jeopardy" uses a particular musical theme to indicate that a contestant is thinking of an answer to the game-show host's question, you decide to include the music in your application. Unfortunately, this effort will not necessarily be understood in other countries.

The localization team can give feedback about the graphics and multimedia components used in the product to ensure that they are suitable for all locales. Even if it were not expensive to design custom graphics for each language, having different images from one language to another can confuse the user who works with more than one language version.
