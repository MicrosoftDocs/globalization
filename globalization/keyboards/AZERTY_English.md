# France's new AZERTY keyboard layout

Windows 11 version 24H4 introduces France’s new standard keyboard layout, an updated version of the “AZERTY” layout.

This new keyboard layout has been designed to address the many deficiencies of the traditional AZERTY layout that has been ubiquitous in France. Most critically, the traditional layout lacks the full set of characters needed to write French. For example, ligatures like ‘æ’ and ‘œ’ are missing, as are French « quotation marks » and the capitalised forms of some accented characters.

The new layout was implemented according to France’s NF Z71-300 national standard. That standard can be purchased from AFNOR, France’s national standards body, here: [Standard NF Z71-300](https://www.boutique.afnor.org/en-gb/standard/nf-z71300/user-interfaces-french-keyboard-layouts-for-office/fa188960/1792)

For more information about the new standard, you can consult AFNOR’s article and FAQ here: [French keyboard: a voluntary standard to make it easier to enter all characters](https://www.afnor.org/en/news/clavier-francais-norme-volontaire-ecriture-francais/)

## The new “French (Standard, AZERTY)” layout in Windows

<iframe src="kbdfrna.html" height="300"></iframe>
 
This keyboard layout is designed to enable you to enter all the accented characters and ligatures commonly used in French. It includes characters that were missing from the legacy AZERTY layout, which are integral to French orthography, such as:

  É Ç æ Æ œ Œ — « » ‹ ›

It can be used to type the characters for all of France’s regional languages, for all Latin-based languages of the European Union, and for Greek. A variety of scientific, financial, and mathematical symbols are also available.

In addition, symbols are logically grouped: all types of brackets have opening and closing forms on adjacent keys; mathematical symbols are grouped to the right of the keyboard, next to the enter key; common punctuation is on the bottom row, to the right of the letter N.

## Typing characters and ligatures using the new French (Standard, AZERTY) keyboard

The new French (Standard, AZERTY) keyboard makes it easier to type:

- [Accented characters and ligatures commonly used in French](#accented-characters-and-ligatures-commonly-used-in-french)

- [Greek letters](#greek-letters-layer)
- [Additional European characters](#additional-european-characters-layer)

#### Other characters not printed on the keys

To keep the physical keyboard looking clean, the keyboard doesn’t feature all the available characters printed on it. The following additional symbols which aren’t printed on the keyboard can be typed:

| Character | Key presses |
| Non-breaking space | AltGr + Space |
| Narrow non-breaking space | AltGr + Shift + Space |
| — | AltGr + Shift + ’ |
| ‹ | AltGr + Shift + « |
| › | AltGr + Shift + » |
| ‰ | AltGr + Shift + P |

#### Dead keys for additional accented characters

Many “dead keys” are provided for typing even more accented characters.

To enter these accented characters, first press the dead key, then follow it with the letter you’d like to add an accent to. If you’d like to type the accent on its own, follow it with a space.

For example, to type a ‘y’ with a diaresis (ÿ), you would press **Shift + ^** followed by **y**.

| Accent | Dead key | Follow with a letter to type: | Follow with a space to type: |
