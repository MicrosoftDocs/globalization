# Typing settings

Typing settings control how users interact with their systems and applications using keyboards or similar devices. Most systems have multiple [keyboard layouts](../windows-keyboard-layouts.md) available to support language and typing conventions in various countries. Languages that users configure their systems to use come with a list of keyboard layouts available by default. Some languages also have additional typing settings besides the keyboard layout, like spelling, grammar, or typographic settings. Examples include the following:

- Arabic spell checking: Strict final yaa
- French spell checking: Traditional and new spellings
- German spell checking: Pre and post-reform rules
- Spanish spell checking: Tuteo and voseo verb forms

<-- For more information about these additional settings, refer to [Dictionaries and spelling](dictionaries-spelling.md). -->

Some languages whose spelling is based on ideograms, like Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, or Korean, require the use of [Input Method Editors (IME)](../input/text-input.md#enable-input-method-editors-imes-and-text-prediction) for typing. IMEs allow users to compose ideograms using input devices that do not support the native ideograms of that language.

Finally, systems, particularly those on smartphones, can include settings related to text prediction models as part of their typing settings. Some of these models are language-specific, and others operate regardless of the selected language. Text prediction models are constantly learning as users type on their devices.
