# UI Language

This variable allows each user to select the language of the UI for such things as dialog boxes, menus, and Help files. This option is only available on the MUI Pack of Windows XP Professional and on the MultiLanguage version of Windows 2000 Professional.

It's important to distinguish between the system UI language and the user UI language. Though it is true that the user UI language is sometimes the same as the system UI, in other instances it is not. The system language is the language of the localized version that was used to set up Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional. All menus, dialog boxes, error messages, and Help files are in this language, except on multilanguage versions (such as on the MUI Pack of Windows XP Professional and the MultiLanguage version of Windows 2000 Professional), where the user can select a different language.

The user UI language on a non-MUI machine would be the same as the system UI language. With MUI, however, the user can change the language by clicking the Languages tab within the Regional And Language Options property sheet. (See Figure 6.) To see the effect of this change, the user will have to log off and then log back on.
