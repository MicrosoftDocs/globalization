# Language Groups and Language Collections

The different languages and scripts that an operating system can support-once the user installs them-are known as "language groups" in Windows 2000. Generally speaking, a language group contains code-page information, keyboard layouts, and fonts. Some language groups also have a scripting engine, which enables the user to edit supported scripts within the operating system.

With Windows 2000 the user can add support for many languages and scripts (including, among others, Western European, Central European, Arabic, Indic, and Turkic languages). Since Windows 2000 and Windows XP are both single, world-ready binaries, functionality for all supported scripts is available on all language versions of these operating systems. If additional languages are needed, the user only needs to install these separately either during or after setup.

In Windows XP, Microsoft has simplified the process of installing these groups by gathering languages with similar properties into a language collection. On English Windows XP, support for all European languages (including Baltic languages, Cyrillic languages, Greek, and Turkic languages)-known as the "Basic Language Collection"-is installed by default. Additional language collections (such as East Asian for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, as well as complex scripts for Arabic, Hebrew, the Indic family of languages, and Thai) can also be installed. (After installing a language group or collection, the user will need to restart the computer.)
