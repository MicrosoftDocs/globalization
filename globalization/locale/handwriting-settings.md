# Handwriting settings

In addition to typing settings, globalized operating systems can offer users the possibility to write by hand in some languages. This requires the system to be installed on a device that has a touchscreen and object character recognition (OCR) capabilities.

Handwriting models are language-specific and thus require the installation of their corresponding recognition models, which is part of the language settings of the operating system. In addition to recognizing the handwritten words, the operating systems can support various gestures that facilitate actions like deleting, joining, and overwriting text.
