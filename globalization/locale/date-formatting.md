# Date formatting

For many use cases, date formatting is not constant through out the world.
Although each date basically displays the year, month, and day, their presentation order and separators vary greatly.
In fact, there may be differences between regions within the same country.

## Long and short data formats

Let's compare long and short date formats between Mexico, Japan, and the United States for the same date.

| Region | Long date |
| -- | -- |
| Mexico        | martes 12 de octubre de 1954 |
| Japan         | <span lang="ja">1954年10月12日</span> |
| United States | Tuesday, October 12, 1954 |

Obviously, the names of the months and days of the week are different from locale to locale.
However, there are other notable differences as well.
For Mexico, the day comes before the month, everything is lowercase and the article "de" ia used.
In Japan, the day of the week is not displayed and the translations for "year", "month" and "day" act like numeric separators.
In the US, the full weekday name is followed by the month name and day number, then the year.

| Region | Short date |
| -- | -- |
| Mexico        | 12/10/54 |
| Japan         | 54/10/12 |
| United States | 10/12/54 |

In the short date, we see that the order of day, month, and year are different in each locale.
A short date is ambiguous without information about what locale is in effect.
For example, the short date specified as ***07/04/01*** could mean:

| Region | Long date (US) |
| -- | -- |
| United States | July 4<sup>th</sup>, 1901 |
| Mexico        | April 7<sup>th</sup>, 2001 |
| Japan         | April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2007 |

These examples shows why you should use the date APIs when dealing with dates.
Not only will they produce the correct format, but they will also display the correct translations for long dates without incurring the cost of translation.

## Universal date format

So far, this discussion has been about formatting dates for display to the user in a user interface.
Dates in storage and transmission should generally be using a locale-independent format, such as a binary representation or text following ISO 8601.
These can then be parsed to a binary date/time and reformatted using locale-aware APIs for display to the user.

For some use cases, such as a package manifest or server log, you may not know a user locale or require a readable format that is not dependent on locale or language.

While there isn't a truly universal format understood by everyone in the world, but you can achieve at least a widely understood, unambiguous, and sortable format that might be acceptable for many use cases: `yyyy-MM-dd`.

Broken down:

- `yyyy` provides an unambiguous 4-digit year.
- `MM` provides a two-digit month number.
- `dd` provides a two digit day.
- Components are separated for readability with a dash (-`).
- Ordered that dates sort properly using a basic efficient string sort.

.NET provides convenient formats for formatting a date designed for transmission (round-trip) (`"o"`), and "universal"/sortable format (`"U"`).
