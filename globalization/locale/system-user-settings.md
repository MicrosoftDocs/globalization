# Operating system and application settings

Although operating systems (OS) offer an out-of-the-box default configuration, users should be able to install other languages and define different aspects of language support.

Your product needs to [identify and respect](user-preferences.md) these [language and region settings](language-settings.md). The settings include the language of the usersâ€™ OS, their preferred language for installed apps, their country or region, and their preferred format for dates and times. Their browser might also have its own language settings, and browser-based applications should respect these settings.
