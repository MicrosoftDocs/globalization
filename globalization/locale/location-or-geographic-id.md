# Location or Geographic ID

This variable is available in Windows XP (and was also available in Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition \[Windows Me\] though not in Windows 2000) to define the country or location where the user lives. Each user can change this variable on the fly by selecting changes from the Regional Options tab of the Regional And Language Options property sheet. Any changes made are also applied on the fly. By selecting a particular location, the user has set a variable that a Web service (such as one that deals with weather) can check, thus allowing the Web service to deliver information and services specific to the region or country the user has selected.
