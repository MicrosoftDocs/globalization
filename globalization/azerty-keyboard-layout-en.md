# France’s new AZERTY keyboard layout

## The new “French (Standard, AZERTY)” layout 

<iframe src="kbdfr.html" height="300"></iframe>

To see different keyboard states, move the mouse over state keys such as **Shift**, **Caps** or **AltGr**. You can also lock or unlock those keys by clicking them.

This keyboard layout is designed to easily allow all the necessary characters for the French language to be entered. It includes characters that were missing from the legacy AZERTY layout which are integral to the French language, such as: 
> É Ç æ Æ œ Œ — « » ‹ › 

It can also be used to type all the necessary characters for all of France’s regional languages, all Latin-based languages of the European Union, and Greek. A variety of scientific, financial, and mathematical symbols are also available. 

In addition, symbols are logically grouped: all types of brackets have opening and closing forms on adjacent keys; mathematical symbols are grouped to the right of the keyboard, beside the enter key; common punctuation is on the bottom row, to the right of the letter N. 

### Typing accented characters and ligatures commonly used in French 

Accented characters and ligatures commonly used in the French language are easy to type, including in their capital forms.

| à | à |

| é | é |
| É | AltGr + Shift + é |
| è | è |

### Other characters not printed on the keys

To keep the physical keyboard looking clean, it doesn’t feature *all* the available characters printed on it. The following additional symbols can be typed which aren’t printed on: 

| Character | Key presses |
|-------|-------|
| Non-breaking space | AltGr + Space |
| Narrow non-breaking space | AltGr + Shift + Space |
| — | AltGr + Shift + ’ |
| ‹ | AltGr + Shift + « |
| › | AltGr + Shift + » |
| ‰ | AltGr + Shift + P |
| − | AltGr + - |
| - | AltGr + Shift + - |
| † | AltGr + + |
| ‡ | AltGr + Shift + + |
| θ | AltGr + Q |
| ∞ | AltGr + M |
| √ | AltGr + Shift + / |
| ¼ | AltGr + Shift + * |
| ⩽ | AltGr + < |
| ⩾ | AltGr + Shift + < |
| ʒ | AltGr + W |
| ¿ | AltGr + Shift + . |
| ¡ | AltGr + Shift + , |
| ≃ | AltGr + ; |
| ≠ | AltGr + Shift + ; |

### Dead keys for additional accented characters 

A large number of “dead keys” are also provided for typing even more accented characters. 

To use these, first press the dead key, then follow it with the letter you’d like to add an accent to. If you’d like to type the accent on its own, follow it with a space. 

For example, to type a ‘y’ with a diaresis (ÿ), you would press **Shift + ^** followed by **y**.
