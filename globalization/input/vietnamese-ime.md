# Vietnamese Telex IME

If you need to enter some text in Vietnamese, the Vietnamese Telex Input Method Editor (IME) for Windows lets you enter text using the Vietnamese alphabet while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys and keeping English as your Windows display language.

## Add the Vietnamese keyboard layout

To add the Vietnamese keyboard layout to Windows:

1. Open Settings and select **Time & language** > **Language & region**.
1. Select **Add a language**. Select **Vietnamese** from the list and select **Next**.
1. Consider if you need any of the **Optional language features**. For entering Vietnamese text while keeping English as your Windows display language, none of them are necessary. When you're happy with your choices, select **Install**.

## Type Vietnamese text

The Windows system tray shows which keyboard layout is currently active, for example, **ENG**. You can switch between installed layouts (those in the **Preferred languages** list in Settings) by pressing the Windows logo key + Spacebar.

If you prefer, you can also change the layout by selecting the system tray icon and selecting the layout from the list. This method can be faster if you have more than two languages installed.

The Vietnamese alphabet is based on the Latin script, but it has some additional letters and does not use f, j, w, and z from the Latin alphabet. It uses digraphs and diacritics to mark tones and some phonemes. The IME helps you to enter these quickly and correctly.

The additional letters of the alphabet are:

| Vietnamese letter | Telex shortcut |
|-------------------|----------------|
| ă | aw |
| â | aa |
| đ | dd |
| ê | ee |
| ô | oo |
| ơ | ow |
| ư | uw |

Additionally, you can add diacritics to some letters by typing an additional English letter:

| Diacritic | Telex shortcut for the letter a | Output |
|-----------|---------------------------------|--------|
| Acute accent | as | á |
| Grave accent | af | à |
| Hook above | ar | ả |
| Tilde | ax | ã |
| Dot below | aj | ạ |

Diacritics can be combined with the Vietnamese letters. For example, you can type ofw or owf with the Vietnamese Telex IME to produce ờ.

To write text in the Vietnamese alphabet, do the following:

1. Select **Vietnamese Telex IME**. The system tray now shows **VIE** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type in Vietnamese.
1. Type the word you want with the English keys, using the shortcuts listed above when you need to enter a letter with digraphs and diacritics.

## Example

The Vietnamese word for garden is vườn.

To type the word, select the Vietnamese Telex keyboard layout from the system tray. Then type vuwofwn with the English keys:

- v
- uw – ư
- ofw – ờ
- n
