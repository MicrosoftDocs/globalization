# Gujarati IME

If you need to enter some text in Gujarati, Windows includes an Input Method Editor and keyboard layouts that let you enter text using the Gujarati script while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys. Using the IME doesn't require changing your current Windows display language.

## Add support for Gujarati input

To add support for Gujarati input to Windows:

1. Open Settings and select **Time & language** > **Language & region**.
1. Select **Add a language**. Select **Gujarati** from the list and select **Next**.
1. Consider if you need any of the **Optional language features**. If you want to enter Gujarati text while keeping your current Windows display language, none of them are necessary. When you're happy with your choices, select **Install**.

By default, Gujarati is installed with the [Gujarati INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinguj.md) keyboard. To install the Microsoft Gujarati Phonetic IME:

1. On the **Language & region** page, select the Options (**…**) icon next to **Gujarati** and select **Language options**.
1. Select **Add a keyboard** and select **Gujarati Phonetic**.

## Type Gujarati text

The Windows system tray shows which keyboard layout is currently active, for example, **ENG**. You can switch between installed layouts (layouts in the **Preferred languages** list in Settings) by selecting the Windows logo key + Spacebar.

If you prefer, you can also change the layout by selecting the system tray icon and selecting the layout from the list. This method can be faster if you have more than two languages installed.

If multiple IME/keyboards are installed for a given language, the list and the tray icon will show a combination of language and layout.

### Use the Gujarati Phonetic IME

To type text in the Gujarati script using the Gujarati Phonetic IME:

1. Select **Gujarati Phonetic**. The system tray now shows **ગુજ** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type in Gujarati.
1. Type the transliteration of the word you want with the English keys. As you type, notice that the Gujarati Phonetic IME automatically converts the English letters into Gujarati script suggestions. When you're finished typing, select Enter to convert your text into the first suggested Gujarati word. You can also use the cursor keys to select a different suggestion.

### Use the Gujarati INSCRIPT keyboard

To type text using the Gujarati INSCRIPT keyboard:

1. Select **Gujarati INSCRIPT**. The system tray now shows **ગુજ** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type using the Gujarati script.
1. Using the [Gujarati INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinhin.md) keyboard layout, type the Gujarati word you want.

## Example

The Gujarati word for garden is બગીચો, which can be transliterated as bagicho.

### Type with the Gujarati Phonetic IME

To type બગીચો, select the Gujarati Phonetic IME from the system tray. Then type *bagicho* with the English keys. As you type, you can see how the IME turns the text into word suggestions. When you're finished typing, the top suggestion is the correct Gujarati word. Select Enter to convert the English letters into Gujarati script.

### Type with the Gujarati INSCRIPT keyboard

To type બગીચો, select the Gujarati INSCRIPT keyboard layout from the system tray. Use the following keystrokes to type the Gujarati word for garden:

| Gujarati letter | Keystroke on the English US keyboard | Phonetic equivalent |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| બ | y | ba |
| ગ | i | ga |
| ◌ી | r | {vowel sign ii} |
| ચ | ; | ch |
| ◌ો | e | {vowel sign o} |

When you're finished typing, the word બગીચો appears on the screen.
