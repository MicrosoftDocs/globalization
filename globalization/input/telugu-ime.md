# Telugu IME

If you need to enter some text in Telugu, Windows includes an Input Method Editor and keyboard layouts that let you enter text using the Telugu script while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys. Using the IME doesn't require changing your current Windows display language.

## Add support for Telugu input

To add support for Telugu input to Windows:

1. Open Settings and select **Time & language** > **Language & region**.
1. Select **Add a language**. Select **Telugu** from the list and select **Next**.
1. Consider if you need any of the **Optional language features**. If you want to enter Telugu text while keeping your current Windows display language, none of them are necessary. When you're happy with your choices, select **Install**.

By default, Telugu is installed with the [Telugu INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdintel.md) keyboard. To install the Telugu Phonetic IME:

1. On the **Language & region** page, select the Options (**…**) icon next to **Telugu** and select **Language options**.
1. Select **Add a keyboard** and select **Telugu Phonetic**.

## Type Telugu text

The Windows system tray shows which keyboard layout is currently active, for example, **ENG**. You can switch between installed layouts (layouts in the **Preferred languages** list in Settings) by selecting the Windows logo key + Spacebar.

If you prefer, you can also change the layout by selecting the system tray icon and selecting the layout from the list. This method can be faster if you have more than two languages installed.

If multiple IME/keyboards are installed for a given language, the list and the tray icon will show a combination of language and layout.

### Use the Telugu Phonetic IME

To type text in the Telugu script using the Telugu Phonetic IME:

1. Select **Telugu Phonetic**. The system tray now shows **తె** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type in Telugu.
1. Type the transliteration of the word you want with the English keys. As you type, notice that the Telugu Phonetic IME automatically converts the English letters into Telugu script suggestions. When you're finished typing, select Enter to convert your text into the first suggested Telugu word. You can also use the cursor keys to select a different suggestion.

### Use the Telugu INSCRIPT keyboard

To type text using the Telugu INSCRIPT keyboard:

1. Select **Telugu INSCRIPT**. The system tray now shows **తె** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type using the Telugu script.
1. Using the [Telugu INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdintel.md) keyboard layout, type the Telugu word you want.

## Example

The Telugu word for garden is తోట, which can be transliterated as tota or thota.

### Type with the Telugu Phonetic IME

To type తోట, select the Telugu Phonetic IME from the system tray. Then type *thota* with the English keys. As you type, you can see how the IME turns the text into word suggestions. When you're finished typing, the top suggestion is the correct Telugu word. Select Enter to convert the English letters into Telugu script.

### Type with the Telugu INSCRIPT keyboard

To type తోట, select the Telugu INSCRIPT keyboard layout from the system tray. Use the following keystrokes to type the Telugu word for garden:

| Telugu letter | Keystroke on the English US keyboard | Phonetic equivalent |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| త | l | ta |
| ◌ో | a | {vowel sign oo} |
| ట | , | tta |

When you're finished typing, the word తోట appears on the screen.
