# Marathi IME

If you need to enter some text in Marathi, Windows includes an Input Method Editor and keyboard layouts that let you enter text using the Devanagari script while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys. Using the IME doesn't require changing your current Windows display language.

## Add support for Marathi input

To add support for Marathi input to Windows:

1. Open Settings and select **Time & language** > **Language & region**.
1. Select **Add a language**. Select **Marathi** from the list and select **Next**.
1. Consider if you need any of the **Optional language features**. If you want to enter Marathi text while keeping English as your Windows display language, none of them are necessary. When you're happy with your choices, select **Install**.

By default, Marathi is installed with the [Marathi INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinmar.md) keyboard. To install the Microsoft Marathi Phonetic IME:

1. On the **Language & region** page, select the Options (**…**) icon next to **Marathi** and select **Language options**.
1. Select **Add a keyboard** and select **Marathi Phonetic**.

## Type Marathi text

The Windows system tray shows which keyboard layout is currently active, for example, **ENG**. You can switch between installed layouts (layouts in the **Preferred languages** list in Settings) by pressing the Windows logo key + Spacebar.

If you prefer, you can also change the layout by selecting the system tray icon and selecting the layout from the list. This method can be faster if you have more than two languages installed.

### Use the Marathi Phonetic IME

To type text in the Devanagari script using the Marathi Phonetic IME:

1. Select **Marathi Phonetic**. The system tray now shows **म** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type in Marathi.
1. Type the transliteration of the word you want with the English keys. As you type, notice that the Marathi Phonetic IME automatically converts the English letters into Devanagari script suggestions. When you're finished typing, press Enter to convert your text into the first suggested Marathi word. You can also use the cursor keys to select a different suggestion.

### Use the Marathi INSCRIPT keyboard

To type text using the Marathi INSCRIPT keyboard:

1. Select **Marathi INSCRIPT**. The system tray now shows **म** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type using the Devanagari script.
1. Using the [Marathi INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinmar.md) keyboard layout, type the Marathi word you want.

## Example

The Marathi word for garden is बाग, which can be transliterated as baaga.

### Type with the Marathi Phonetic IME

To type बाग, select the Marathi Phonetic IME from the system tray. Then type *baaga* with the English keys. As you type, you can see how the IME turns the text into word suggestions. When you're finished typing, the top suggestion is the correct Marathi word. Press Enter to convert the English letters into Devanagari script.

### Type with the Marathi INSCRIPT keyboard

To type बाग, select the Marathi INSCRIPT keyboard layout from the system tray. Use the following keystrokes to type the Marathi word for garden:

| Devanagari letter | Keystroke on the English US keyboard | Phonetic equivalent |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| ब | y | ba |
| ◌ा | e | {vowel sign aa} |
| ग | i | ga |

When you're finished typing, the word बाग appears on the screen.
