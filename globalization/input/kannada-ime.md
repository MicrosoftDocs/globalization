# Kannada IME

If you need to enter some text in Kannada, Windows includes an Input Method Editor and keyboard layouts that let you enter text using the Kannada script while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys. Using the IME doesn't require changing your current Windows display language.

## Add support for Kannada input

To add support for Kannada input to Windows:

1. Open Settings and select **Time & language** > **Language & region**.
1. Select **Add a language**. Select **Kannada** from the list and select **Next**.
1. Consider if you need any of the **Optional language features**. If you want to enter Kannada text while keeping your current Windows display language, none of them are necessary. When you're happy with your choices, select **Install**.

By default, Kannada is installed with the [Kannada INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinkan.md) keyboard. To install the Kannada Phonetic IME:

1. On the **Language & region** page, select the Options (**…**) icon next to **Kannada** and select **Language options**.
1. Select **Add a keyboard** and select **Kannada Phonetic**.

## Type Kannada text

The Windows system tray shows which keyboard layout is currently active, for example, **ENG**. You can switch between installed layouts (layouts in the **Preferred languages** list in Settings) by selecting the Windows logo key + Spacebar.

If you prefer, you can also change the layout by selecting the system tray icon and selecting the layout from the list. This method can be faster if you have more than two languages installed.

If multiple IME/keyboards are installed for a given language, the list and the tray icon will show a combination of language and layout.

### Use the Kannada Phonetic IME

To type text in the Kannada script using the Kannada Phonetic IME:

1. Select **Kannada Phonetic**. The system tray now shows **ಕ** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type in Kannada.
1. Type the transliteration of the word you want with the English keys. As you type, notice that the Kannada Phonetic IME automatically converts the English letters into Kannada script suggestions. When you're finished typing, select Enter to convert your text into the first suggested Kannada word. You can also use the cursor keys to select a different suggestion.

### Use the Kannada INSCRIPT keyboard

To type text using the Kannada INSCRIPT keyboard:

1. Select **Kannada INSCRIPT**. The system tray now shows **ಕ** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type using the Kannada script.
1. Using the [Kannada INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinkan.md) keyboard layout, type the Kannada word you want.

## Example

The Kannada word for garden is ಉದ್ಯಾನ, which can be transliterated as udyaana.

### Type with the Kannada Phonetic IME

To type ಉದ್ಯಾನ, select the Kannada Phonetic IME from the system tray. Then type *udyaana* with the English keys. As you type, you can see how the IME turns the text into word suggestions. When you're finished typing, the top suggestion is the correct Kannada word. Select Enter to convert the English letters into Kannada script.

### Type with the Kannada INSCRIPT keyboard

To type ಉದ್ಯಾನ, select the Kannada INSCRIPT keyboard layout from the system tray. Use the following keystrokes to type the Kannada word for garden:

| Kannada letter | Keystroke on the English US keyboard | Phonetic equivalent |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| ಉ | G | u |
| ದ | o | da |
| ◌್ | d | {virama - isolates the consonant from da} |
| ಯ | / | ya |
| ◌ಾ | e | {vowel sign aa} |
| ನ | v | na |

When you're finished typing, the word ಉದ್ಯಾನ appears on the screen.
