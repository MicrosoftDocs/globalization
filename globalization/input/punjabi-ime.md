# Punjabi IME

If you need to enter some text in Punjabi, Windows includes an Input Method Editor and keyboard layouts that let you enter text using the Gurmukhi script while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys. Using the IME doesn't require changing your current Windows display language.

## Add support for Punjabi input

To add support for Punjabi input to Windows:

1. Open Settings and select **Time & language** > **Language & region**.
1. Select **Add a language**. Select **Punjabi (Gurmukhi)** from the list and select **Next**.
1. Consider if you need any of the **Optional language features**. If you want to enter Punjabi text while keeping English as your Windows display language, none of them are necessary. When you're happy with your choices, select **Install**.

By default, Punjabi is installed with the [Punjabi INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinpun.md) keyboard. To install the Microsoft Punjabi Phonetic IME:

1. On the **Language & region** page, select the Options (**…**) icon next to **Punjabi (Gurmukhi)** and select **Language options**.
1. Select **Add a keyboard** and select **Punjabi Phonetic**.

## Type Punjabi text

The Windows system tray shows which keyboard layout is currently active, for example, **ENG**. You can switch between installed layouts (layouts in the **Preferred languages** list in Settings) by pressing the Windows logo key + Spacebar.

If you prefer, you can also change the layout by selecting the system tray icon and selecting the layout from the list. This method can be faster if you have more than two languages installed.

### Use the Punjabi Phonetic IME

To type text in the Gurmukhi script using the Punjabi Phonetic IME:

1. Select **Punjabi Phonetic**. The system tray now shows **ਪੰ** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type in Punjabi.
1. Type the transliteration of the word you want with the English keys. As you type, notice that the Punjabi Phonetic IME automatically converts the English letters into Gurmukhi script suggestions. When you're finished typing, press Enter to convert your text into the first suggested Punjabi word. You can also use the cursor keys to select a different suggestion.

### Use the Punjabi INSCRIPT keyboard

To type text using the Punjabi INSCRIPT keyboard:

1. Select **Punjabi INSCRIPT**. The system tray now shows **ਪੰ** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type using the Gurmukhi script.
1. Using the [Punjabi INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinpun.md) keyboard layout, type the Punjabi word you want.

## Example

The Punjabi word for garden is ਬਾਗ, which can be transliterated as baaga.

### Type with the Punjabi Phonetic IME

To type ਬਾਗ, select the Punjabi Phonetic IME from the system tray. Then type *baaga* with the English keys. As you type, you can see how the IME turns the text into word suggestions. When you're finished typing, the top suggestion is the correct Punjabi word. Press Enter to convert the English letters into Gurmukhi script.

### Type with the Punjabi INSCRIPT keyboard

To type ਬਾਗ, select the Punjabi INSCRIPT keyboard layout from the system tray. Use the following keystrokes to type the Punjabi word for garden:

| Gurmukhi letter | Keystroke on the English US keyboard | Phonetic equivalent |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| ਬ | y | ba |
| ◌ਾ | e | {vowel sign aa} |
| ਗ | i | ga |

When you're finished typing, the word ਬਾਗ appears on the screen.
