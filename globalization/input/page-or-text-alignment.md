# Page or Text Alignment

In typesetting and page layout, alignment is the setting of text flow or image placement relative to a page, column (measure), table cell or tab. Type alignment sometimes referred to as “text alignment”, “text justification”, “type justification”, or “document direction.” Additionally, this may be referred to as Reading Order; Reading Order is a method that describes the order in which a block of text is displayed—sometimes in contrast with how the text is entered or stored (logical order).

To describe how a text flows into lines, one needs to know three things:

-   which way the text flows within a line (text direction or alignment)
-   which way the lines stack (block progression)
-   which way the glyphs are facing (glyph orientation, that is, do the glyphs need to be rotated if the flow changes)

Chinese may be written either horizontally (read left-to-right, then top-to-bottom as English is) or vertically (read top-to-bottom, then right-to-left)—sometimes in the same document! This is called a bi-orientational script; see the image below for examples of each orientation. Other East Asian languages such as Japanese (Kanji) and Yi also have the same text alignment.

Hanunó’o script
(Source: Conklin, Harold. 1953. Hanunoo-English Vocabulary. Berkeley: University of California Press. \[University of California Publications in Linguistics 9:1-290\])
ᜣᜫᜨᜰᜲᜪᜲᜮᜯ᜵ ᜨᜰᜲᜮᜰᜯᜩᜰ᜵ ᜫᜠᜮᜥᜯᜲᜢᜮ᜶

The following are general context rules for the reading order and alignment of text:

-   If the first strong character is left to right, reading order will be left to right and text will be left aligned.
-   If the first strong character is right to left, reading order will be right to left and text will be right aligned.
-   If only neutral characters are typed, the reading order and the alignment will follow the paragraph direction (can be left to right, or right to left) until the first strong character is typed.

Any time you change the first strong character from a left-to-right language to a right-to-left language, and vice versa, the reading order and the alignment change accordingly.

The text direction and cultural expectations can impact other features. For example, lines with Japanese or Korean text will have the underline appear on the right, while Chinese (Simplified and Traditional scripts) on the left. The positions of punctuation marks, for example, the relative position of commas and full stops, differ between horizontal and vertical writing. Punctuation such as parentheses, quotation marks, book title marks (Chinese), ellipsis mark, dash, wavy dash (Japanese), proper noun mark (Chinese), wavy book title mark (Chinese), emphasis mark, and cho-on mark (Japanese) are all rotated 90 degrees when switching between horizontal and vertical text.

[Ruby characters](overlay.md), which provide a phonetic guide for unusual or difficult- to-read characters, follow the direction of the main text. Inserted text in the Roman alphabet is usually written horizontally, or turned sideways when it appears in vertical text, with the base of the characters on the left.

When a text is written in horizontal format, pages are read in the same order as English books, with the binding at the left and pages progressing to the right. Vertical books are printed the other way around, with the binding at the right, and pages progressing to the left.

For bidirectional languages—such as Arabic and Hebrew—the text should be aligned to the right and the overall text direction is right-to-left. A right-to-left document is characterized by the following:

-   the default cursor position is on the right side;
-   the default paragraph direction is right aligned;
-   text flows from the right side to the left side;
-   the default reading order is right-to-left;
-   if they exist, column names and row names originate and increase from top-right corner leftwards and towards the bottom; and
-   if they exist, tabs originate from either the top-right or the bottom-right side and increase towards the left.
