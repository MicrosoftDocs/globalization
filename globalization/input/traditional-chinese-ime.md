# Traditional Chinese IME

If you need to enter some text in Traditional Chinese, Windows includes several Input Method Editors (IMEs) to let you enter text using Traditional Chinese characters while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys. Using the IME doesn't require changing your current Windows display language.

This article discusses the following IMEs:

- Chinese Traditional Array: Chinese Traditional Array is a shape-based input method that enables you to use the structure of characters to input text. Each Traditional Chinese character can be decomposed to one or more elements or radicals. The Chinese Traditional Array IME allows users to use keystrokes that correspond to the decomposed elements to build up a final character.
- Chinese Traditional DaYi: DaYi is a shape-based input method that enables users to use the shape of characters to input text. Each Traditional Chinese character can be decomposed to one or more elements or radicals. The DaYi IME allows users to use keystrokes that correspond to the decomposed elements to build up a final character. DaYi uses stroke order to organize the decomposed characters, rather than geometric shape that is used in ChangJie.
- Microsoft Bopomofo: Bopomofo (also known as Zhuyin) is a phonetic system. Users type the phonemes of the Chinese character.
- Microsoft ChangJie: ChangJie (or Cangjie) or  is a shape-based input method that enables users to use the shape of characters to input text. Each Traditional Chinese character can be decomposed to one or more elements or radicals. The ChangJie IME allows users to use keystrokes that correspond to the decomposed elements to build up a final character. ChangJie uses geometric shape to organize the decomposed characters, rather than stroke order that is used in DaYi.
- Microsoft Quick: Quick is also known as Simplified ChangJie. It lets users enter a character’s first and the last stroke used in the full ChangJie system and then pick a character from the conversion candidate window.

## Add support for Traditional Chinese input

To add support for Traditional Chinese input to Windows:

1. Open Settings and select **Time & language** > **Language & region**.
1. Select **Add a language**. Select **Chinese (Traditional, Hong Kong SAR)** from the list and select **Next**.
1. Consider if you need any of the **Optional language features**. If you want to enter Traditional Chinese text while keeping your current Windows display language, none of them are necessary. When you're happy with your choices, select **Install**.

By default, Traditional Chinese support is installed with the Microsoft Quick IME. To any of the other IMEs:

1. On the **Language & region** page, select the Options (**…**) icon next to **Chinese (Traditional, Hong Kong SAR)** and select **Language options**.
1. Select **Add a keyboard** and select the IME that you want to install.

## Type Traditional Chinese text

The Windows system tray shows which keyboard layout is currently active, for example, **ENG**. You can switch between installed layouts (layouts in the **Preferred languages** list in Settings) by selecting the Windows logo key + Spacebar.

If you prefer, you can also change the layout by selecting the system tray icon and selecting the layout from the list. This method can be faster if you have more than two languages installed.

If multiple IME/keyboards are installed for a given language, the list and the tray icon will show a combination of language and layout.

Type the last three symbols and select the Spacebar. The second character is formed, and you see the first character changes to form the completed word.

### Type with the ChangJie IME

The character 夏 is decomposed to the radicals 一, 山, 竹, and 水, while the character 天 can be decomposed to 一 and 大. On an English keyboard:

- the radical 一 is entered using the m key
- the radical 山 is entered using the u key
- the radical 竹 is entered using the h key
