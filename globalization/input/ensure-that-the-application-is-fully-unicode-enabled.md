# Ensure that the Application is fully Unicode enabled

Do not assume user data will only be entered in your script; software should be [Unicode enabled](https://msdn.microsoft.com/globalization/mt683841). Users should also be able to use extended characters in all parts of your product, such as in:

-   document text,
-   file names,
-   directories,
-   server names,
-   user names, and
-   generally, all text strings used in any way throughout your product.
