# Yi IME

If you need to enter some text in Yi (also known as Nuosu), Windows includes an Input Method Editor that lets you enter text using the Yi script while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys. Using the IME doesn't require changing your current Windows display language.

## Add support for Yi input

To add support for Yi input to Windows:

1. Open Settings and select **Time & language** > **Language & region**.
1. Select **Add a language**. Select **Yi** from the list and select **Next**.
1. Consider if you need any of the **Optional language features**. If you want to enter Yi text while keeping your current Windows display language, none of them are necessary. When you're happy with your choices, select **Install**.

## Type Yi text

The Windows system tray shows which keyboard layout is currently active, for example, **ENG**. You can switch between installed layouts (layouts in the **Preferred languages** list in Settings) by selecting the Windows logo key + Spacebar.

If you prefer, you can also change the layout by selecting the system tray icon and selecting the layout from the list. This method can be faster if you have more than two languages installed.

If multiple IME/keyboards are installed for a given language, the list and the tray icon will show a combination of language and layout.

Yi script is a [syllabic](../fonts-layout/writing-systems.md#syllabic) system, which means that each character represents a syllable. The Yi IME converts phonemes that you enter to the Yi characters.

### To write text in Yi

1. Select **Yi Input Method**. The system tray now shows **彝** instead of **ENG**, and a new icon showing **ꆈ** (indicating Yi input mode) appears next to it. To change between Chinese and English input (indicated by **A**), select the Shift key or select the input mode icon.
1. Type the phonemes you want with the English keys.

## Example

The Yi word for winter is ꈊꃀ, which can be transliterated as ket-mop.

To type the word, select the Yi Input Method from the system tray. Then type using the corresponding English keys:

- ket - ꈊ
- mop – ꃀ

After typing each syllable, select the Yi character from the list that appears. To accept the first suggestion, select Enter or Spacebar. To select a different suggestion, use the cursor keys to navigate the list.
