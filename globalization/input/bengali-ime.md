# Bengali IME

If you need to enter some text in Bengali (also known as Bangla), Windows includes an Input Method Editor and keyboard layouts that let you enter text using the Bengali script while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys. Using the IME doesn't require changing your current Windows display language.

## Add support for Bengali input

To add support for Bengali input to Windows:

1. Open Settings and select **Time & language** > **Language & region**.
1. Select **Add a language**. Select **Bengali (India)** from the list and select **Next**.
1. Consider if you need any of the **Optional language features**. If you want to enter Bengali text while keeping your current Windows display language, none of them are necessary. When you're happy with your choices, select **Install**.

By default, Bengali support is installed with the [Bangla INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinbe2.md) keyboard. To install the Microsoft Bangla Phonetic IME:

1. On the **Language & region** page, select the Options (**…**) icon next to **Bengali (India)** and select **Language options**.
1. Select **Add a keyboard** and select **Bangla Phonetic**.

## Type Bengali text

The Windows system tray shows which keyboard layout is currently active, for example, **ENG**. You can switch between installed layouts (layouts in the **Preferred languages** list in Settings) by selecting the Windows logo key + Spacebar.

If you prefer, you can also change the layout by selecting the system tray icon and selecting the layout from the list. This method can be faster if you have more than two languages installed.

If multiple IME/keyboards are installed for a given language, the list and the tray icon will show a combination of language and layout.

### Use the Bangla Phonetic IME

To type text using the Bangla Phonetic IME:

1. Select **Bangla Phonetic**. The system tray now shows **বাং** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type using the Bengali script.
1. Type the transliteration of the word you want with the English keys. As you type, notice that the Bangla Phonetic IME automatically converts the English letters into Bengali script suggestions. When you're finished typing, select Enter to convert your text into the first suggested Bengali word. You can also use the cursor keys to select a different suggestion.

### Use the Bangla INSCRIPT keyboard

To type text using the Bangla INSCRIPT keyboard:

1. Select **Bangla INSCRIPT**. The system tray now shows **বাং** instead of **ENG** indicating that you can now type using the Bengali script.
1. Using the [Bangla INSCRIPT](../keyboards/kbdinbe2.md) keyboard layout, type the Bengali word you want. The Bangla INSCRIPT keyboard layout is based on the traditional typewriter layout for Bengali script.

## Example

The Bengali word for garden is বাগান, which can be transliterated as bagan or baagaana.

### Type with the Bangla Phonetic IME

To type বাগান, select the Bangla Phonetic IME from the system tray. Then type *bagan* with the English keys. As you type, you can see how the IME turns the text into word suggestions. When you're finished typing, the top suggestion is the correct Bengali word. Select Enter to convert the English letters into Bengali script.

### Type with the Bangla INSCRIPT Keyboard

To type বাগান, select the Bangla Phonetic keyboard layout from the system tray. Use the following keystrokes to type the Bengali word for garden:

| Bengali letter | Keystroke on the English US keyboard | Phonetic equivalent |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| ব | y (or b) | ba |
| ◌া | e | {vowel sign aa} |
| গ | i | ga |
| ◌া | e | {vowel sign aa} |
| ন | v | na |

When you're finished typing, the word বাগান appears on the screen.
