# User input

Several areas related to user input need to be considered when interacting with localized applications.

## International users and keyboard layouts

Hardware keyboards can switch between multiple keyboard layouts. Software or on-screen keyboards usually have a similar layout to the currently selected hardware keyboard layout. For more information, see [Hardware and software keyboards](keyboards.md).

All keyboard layouts available in Windows are listed in [Windows keyboard layouts](../windows-keyboard-layouts.md).

Input Method Editors (IME) let users enter characters in languages such as Japanese and Chinese while using a typical keyboard with 101-105 keys. Windows offers IMEs for such languages, but itâ€™s also possible to develop your own. For more information, see [Input Method Editors (IME)](input-method-editors.md).

IMEs for the following languages are covered in more detail:

- [Japanese IME](japanese-ime.md)
- [Korean IME](korean-ime.md)
- [Simplified Chinese IME](simplified-chinese-ime.md)
- [Traditional Chinese IME](traditional-chinese-ime.md)

## Keyboard shortcuts in localized applications

Keyboard shortcuts might need to be modified for localized applications. For more information, see [Keyboard shortcuts and localization](hotkeys-accelerators.md).
