# Images, icons, and colors

Images and icons are a major part of a well-designed graphical user interface (GUI). The advantage of using images and icons is that with one picture a whole concept can be depicted. One reason behind this is that a picture evokes shared experiences that everyone has within their culture. When it comes to software localizability, this strength from shared experiences becomes a potential weakness for images and icons. Not all cultures share the same experiences or backgrounds.

In the early days of GUIs, there were several common icons and images that have since lost popularity. For example, an image of a US roadside mailbox was used to indicate mail. The US-style mailbox isn't commonly used in other countries, so that symbol was superseded by the letter symbol. GUIs have now settled on several symbols that are broadly understood, including a magnifying glass for search, one or two gears for settings, and a star for favorites.

When you choose images and icons, there are several best practices.

- Cultural-specific images: as in the mailbox/letter example, consider whether the symbol has the same meaning in all target markets.
- Flags: where possible, avoid flags and other political symbols. Flags represent countries/regions. There might not be universal recognition of those countries/regions or the ideals, boundaries, and political beliefs for which they stand. Countries should never represent languages. Choosing one country to represent the entire collection of language speakers is exclusionary and potentially offensive.
- Maps: maps, especially those showing political boundaries such as countries and regions, are problematic. Political boundaries are often in dispute, so illustrating boundaries or labeling areas can cause offense. For example, the same body of water is known as the East Sea in Korea, but the Sea of Japan in Japan. Where maps and boundaries can't be avoided, consider using different boundaries and names for the various target markets when in dispute.
- Religious symbols: religious symbols aren't limited to common icons such as a cross or an ichthys for Christianity or the crescent and star for Islam. Christmas trees and Easter bunnies are associated with Christian religious holidays and so might be unfamiliar or potentially offensive for other cultures.
- Gestures: because of the widespread use of the OK gesture (👌U+1F44C OK HAND SIGN) representing agreement, the gesture and the associated meaning have broad worldwide recognition. However, in many countries, the joining of the thumb and index finger can be used in gestures with many other meanings. Avoid using gestures or anatomical symbols to represent concepts as the meaning might not be conveyed correctly in target markets.
- Skin tones: while the (nonrealistic) yellow skin tone for emoji is often considered neutral, the choice of using the yellow skin tone or selecting any of the five [emoji modifiers](emoji.md#emoji-modifiers) to alter the skin tone will always include an implicit race-based decision. Outlines, such as the following icon showing two people, are a better choice where possible, potentially avoiding issues around race, gender stereotyping, and ableism.

- Photos and stock art: marketing, such as hero images on web pages, frequently uses images of people, products, or locations that are familiar to the target audience. As the target market changes, consider whether you also need to update the images to appeal to the new target audience.

## Color choice in marketing

Color psychology is a field of study around how color affects human behavior. The influence of color depends on several factors including culture. For example, in some cultures blue is associated with virtue and protection, while in others it represents mourning. Marketing teams typically choose color palettes to make marketing materials more appealing to the target audience. When you target new markets, you might need to consider a different color palette to convey the equivalent brand messaging.
