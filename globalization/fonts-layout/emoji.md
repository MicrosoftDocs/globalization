# Emoji

Emojis are pictorial symbols (pictographs) that represent objects such as faces, places, weather, and animals. They're typically used with or as a replacement for text to add context via emotions.

While earlier versions of the Unicode standard included pictographic symbols, [Unicode 6.0](http://unicode.org/reports/tr51/), released in October 2010 specified a set of 722 emoji. Subsequent Unicode versions continue to expand the number of emoji defined by the standard.

To display glyphs in defined in the Unicode standard in your UI, the font that you use needs to support the glyphs that you're using. Similarly, to display emoji, the device, browser, or font used must be able to represent the emoji.

Emoji can be convenient when conveying gestures, facial expressions, and other nonverbal elements of communication in text-based messages. However, like nonverbal communication, these cues and meanings vary by context. Context could include the sender’s and the recipient’s language, culture, and social group. In other words, when localizing emoji, you need to be especially careful that the intended meaning is conveyed correctly and appropriately for the target audience.
