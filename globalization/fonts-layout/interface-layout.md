# User interface layout

The user interface (UI) layout defines how various controls, such as labels, check boxes, sliders, date pickers, and buttons, are organized within an application. Many applications are designed to support multiple platforms and form factors so [responsive design techniques](adaptive-ui.md) are now best practice.

For languages such as Arabic and Hebrew that use right-to-left scripts, the UI layout should follow the natural [right-to left directionality](text-directionality.md).

UI design involves using [icons, images, and colors](images-icons-colors.md) to convey the brand experience and to guide the user through your application. In addition to standard design language considerations such as meaning, sizing, alignment, and consistency, consider potential cultural issues in target markets worldwide.
