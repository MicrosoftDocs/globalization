# Displaying text within a user interface

User interface text is text that appears on UI surfaces. This text includes control labels, static text, and user input:

- Control labels identify controls and are placed directly on or next to the controls.
- Static text isn't part of an interactive control and provides users with detailed instructions or explanations so they can make informed decisions.
- User input is text that users enter into controls like text boxes.

When providing a localized application for your users, translating the user interface text is a key part of the process. However, when dealing with text in various languages, translating the strings is just one factor to consider. Other factors include:

- Text layout
  - [Fonts](fonts.md) and [emojis](emoji.md)
  - [Bidirectional text](text-directionality.md)
  - [Justification](text-justification.md)
  - [Line and word breaking](line-and-word-breaking.md)
- Text support
  - [Code pages](../encoding/encoding-overview.md), including Unicode
- Resource authoring
  - [Externalization](../localizability/isolate-localizable-resources.md)
  - [Message formatting](../localizability/string-handling.md)
