# Simultaneous shipping

Simultaneous shipping (or "sim-ship") means to release all localized versions of a given software product, together with the source version.

In today's globalized world, reaching the full extent of your audience requires you to simultaneously ship all of the localized versions offered.
A couple of decades ago, sim-ship was a great challenge, or impossible.
Many constraints work against sim-ship: development models, long milestones, localization engineering challenges, and a slow translation pipeline with multiple translation agencies and small pools of translators.
This often required in-house localizers and limited to a few languages, with a delivery timeline of at least a month after the first wave.

Today, things have changed significantly in all fronts.
Ready-to-ship software updates can be available even a couple of times per day.
Localization service providers can turn around a considerable volume of translations in just a few hours.

Being able to ship all languages simultaneously requires an integrated [continuous localization](continuous-localization.md) system.
