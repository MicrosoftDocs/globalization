# Roles and responsibilities

As with all aspects of product development, a role framework is useful for understanding the jobs to be done for localization.
A large organization may have specialists that fulfill each of these specific roles.
In a small organization, individuals may cover more of the roles described here.

To establish this framework, we define two areas of work in the internationalization pipeline:

* **upstream** tasks at the source level
* **downstream** tasks for localization target locales

## Upstream  roles

* architect
* designer
* developer
* content creator
* product/program manager (strategy and product design)
* user experience designer
* project management (tracking and scheduling)

## Downstream roles

* developer
* tester
* translator
* local content creator
* language validator
* project manager (translation coordination)

The timing for engaging in the activities for each role is critical.
If world-readiness isn't considered at each step, particularly in the upstream activities, the ability to create localized versions is at risk and fixing it's expensive.

## Responsibilities

Another perspective is to examine the activities that each role is responsible for.

Managerial activities include:

* Design global features
* Define [exit criteria](exit-criteria.md) to measure international status and progress
* Define visual style guides, including mirroring
* Define content style guides, covering terminology and usage.
* Establish issue tracking for the localization process and locale-specific issues.
* Schedule alignments between development and the translation provider

Technical activities include:

* Enable localization:
  * Externalize localizable resources
  * Comment resources
  * Create the translation pipeline
  * Create localized builds
* Employ globalization APIs
* Validate (test) functionality
* Validate localizability
