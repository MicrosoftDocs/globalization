# Global products under rapid development

Rapid development is perhaps the most common development methodology used in the software industry today.
You may encounter the strategy under the term "Agile", or some variant of agile.
In contrast with classical development methodologies, cycles are fast, with daily, weekly, or monthly sprints that deliver finished functionality.

Global and international requirements can fundamentally affect the design and implementation of every component in an application or system.
That's why it's vital to start with a baseline that enables localization, even you are not actually translating anything yet.

Once a feature is delivered, it can become difficult to go back and re-engineer for globalization.
People working on those features (the feature crew) may have moved on to other features for the next sprint.

Globalization and international development concerns are best addressed within each sprint when a feature is created.
This is the same principle described in [Start early](index.md#start-early), but applied to the sprint.
The more aspects of globalization that you can address within the sprint, the fewer bugs and issues that will have to be addressed downstream.

Once you have the overview of the strategy and processes, you can get into more detailed implementation considerations:
