# Global products under agile development

Agile development, under many different variants, is perhaps the most common development methodology used in the software industry today.
In contrast with classical development methodologies, cycles are fast, with daily, weekly, or monthly sprints that deliver finished functionality.
Planning for the next milestone or sprint may happen on-the-fly, depending on customer feedback, strategy updates, and other factors.
Once a sprint is delivered, it becomes difficult to go back and fix issues with previous implementation, since people working on those features (the feature crew) may have moved on to other features for the upcoming sprint.

Global and international requirements can fundamentally affect the design and implementation of every component in an application or system.
So, it is important to ensure that the particularities of globalization and international development are addressed within each sprint.

Consider the following aspects:

- [Roles and responsibilities](roles-and-responsibilities.md)
- [Continuous delivery](continuous-delivery.md)
- [Simultaneous shipping](simultaneous-shipping.md)
- [Exit criteria](exit-criteria.md)

Once you have the overview of the strategy and processes, you can get into more detailed implementation considerations:

- [International design](international-design.md)
