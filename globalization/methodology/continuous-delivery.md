# Continuous delivery

A rapid development model with continuous integration and continuous delivery calls for continuous localization.

In a classic development model, localization handoffs happen at the end of a major milestone, such as "visual freeze".
These handoffs can be large and may take a long time to be handed back.

With short sprints delivering complete features, your localization model requires a move to rapid delivery.
Taking occasional snapshots for hand-off doesn't fit the agile development model.
If localizations arrive after the sprint is done, it can be challenging to go back and fix any issues that are discovered:
the feature team has already moved on to other work.

Continuous localization requires a tight integration with your development system.
Automation and integration for the entire translation roundtrip are essential.
Many localization service providers can turn around a considerable volume of new translations in just a few hours.
Some provide integration APIs or tools that offer tight integration between your development system and the provider's translation management system.

Continuous localization may also demand adjustments to the business model and service agreements with localization suppliers.
