# Global product delivery

Global product delivery means giving each customer a rich experience that goes beyond the basic function of the product.
As a customer, the product feels like it was created specifically for you.
The product feels like it belongs to your culture, language, and region.

World-readiness can be challenging to retrofit to an existing application.
There are issues in all aspects of product development: planning, methodology, architecture, implementation, build, and test.
Building global awareness and localizability into the application from the start is far less expensive in the long run.
Even if your initial release is in only one language, a world-ready application can reach more markets.
When you're ready to localize into to more languages, the cost is lower because your organization and the application are already prepared.

When planning, be intentional and specific about the scope of your audience by country, region, and language.

Know your markets and audiences to be more relevant to your customers.
We all come with an intuitive sense of what is acceptable and expected based on our own cultural and regional experience.
The experiences of people elsewhere in the world can be remarkably different.
Consider these aspects, that may vary widely by locale and language:

- Education
- Literacy
- Experience with computers
- Proficiency in another language (such as English)
- Access to technology and bandwidth

To avoid surprises when you release your product, research the legal and regulatory requirements for each locale.

Delivering software products worldwide can be a complex process that involves many disciplines within an organization.
Global product delivery requires awareness and participation from:

- Research and development
- Content development
- Legal affairs
- Marketing
- Operations
- Procurement
- Finance
- Localization
- Sales and support
